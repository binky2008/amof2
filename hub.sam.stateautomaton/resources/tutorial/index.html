					<h1>Model Driven Language Development</h1>
					<p>We, at the System Analysis Group, research the use of meta-modelling and the use of meta-models for the model driven development of languages, tools for languages, and the use of those languages in model driven software development processes.</p>
					<p>This site presents our ideas about how to design languages, using a model driven approach to language development. Our tools for language development <i><a href="aMOF2.0forJava/index.html">A MOF 2.0 for Java</a> </i>and <i><a href="mopa/index.html">MOPA</a></i> are presented in sub-sites (also navigable via the navigation on top of this text).</p>
					<h2>A new modelling paradigm</h2>
					<p>There is a trend away from <i>all covering mammoth modelling languages</i> towards languages that are specially designed for a specific purpose or intention. This can be done by extend an established language with &quot;flexible&quot; semantics with concepts tailored for special need. This is known as <b>language profiling</b>. Another possibility is the emerging paradigm <b>language oriented programming</b>, where the programming environments (modelling and programming languages) are no longer static, given tools; the programming or modelling environment itself is adopted to the specific needs of the developer.</p>
					<p>The key both approaches is an easy and fast development of specific languages or language extensions that were designed to fit the special needs of a concrete software engineering problem. There are two things needed for such a fast and easy language development: A technique to model a language, rather than just to build tools that represent the language; and the possibility to reuse and modify existing libraries of language models, rather than implement common language concepts over and over again. Therefore language development has to model driven.</p>
					<p>We need short development cycles and we need to adopt to changes fast,  we need to abstract from complex systems, using models and we need model centric development. What is true for software development is also true for the development of languages. And most importantly, the development of software is no longer independent from the development of the languages used to build the software. Therefore language development has to be model driven.</p>

					<h2>Using our tools for Model Driven Language Development</h2>
					<h3>Abstract Syntax</h3>
					<p>We use a standardizes meta-modelling approach for storing and managing both, languages (meta-models) and programs (models). Our meta-modelling tool <i>A MOF 2.0 for Java </i>is a UML/MOF 2.0 CMOF implementation for the Java programming language. You can use an UML compliant editor to model the statics of your language, exchange artefacts via XMI, generate repositories for the programs (models) of your language, and bring your languages to live by using the generated repositories.</p>
					<h3>Semantics</h3>
					<p>There are different approaches to cover the semantics of a language:</p>
					<h4>Translational Semantics</h4>
					<p>Translational semantics describe semantics by translating constructs of a source language to the constructs of a target language, with already defined semantics. This way, the semantics of the source language are determined by the target language semantics.</p>
					<p>We use <i>MOPA</i> to realize translational semantics. <i>MOPA</i> is an abbreviation for Model Pattern and it is a tool to analyse general tree like data-structures. <i>MOPA</i> can be used to write pattern for models, traverse models by patterns, and execute semantic code blocks, depending on pattern matching. We use <i>MOPA</i> to create model transformations and code generation for source languages modelled with <i>A MOF 2.0 for Java</i>.</p>
					<h4>Operational Semantics</h4>
					<p>Defining operational semantics means to define operations for the constructs of your language, and provide the meaning of those constructs by implementing those operations.</p>
					<p>With <i>A MOF 2.0 for Java </i>you can declare language concepts and their operations, and provide your own Java implementations for those operations, thus you can define operational semantics.</p>
					<h4>Extensional Semantics</h4>
					<p>Extensional semantics means to take an abstract concept that already has semantics and refine those concept and its semantics.</p>
					<p>Since <i>A MOF 2.0 for Java </i>covers UML/MOF 2.0's new features to model refinement and subsetting relations between concepts features in addition to traditional concept specialization, it is best fit to model extensional semantics. For operational semantics the usual object-orientation features apply, like the overriding or use of inherited operations. To extent translational semantics you can use <i>MOPA's</i> feature to model patterns polymorphic; by using abstract constructs in your patterns, you can create patterns that also match any extension of those constructs the pattern was originally intend for.</p>
					<!--<h2>Further Documentation</h2>
					<p>We are currently working on an larger example that includes the modelling of a well known formal method in a language, on that we want to show how to model abstract syntax, translational, operational and extensional semantics with our tools.</p>-->
