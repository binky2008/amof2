An awkward Association: Class::Kernel::Classes-Kernel-A_navigableOwnedEnd_association
A lot of awkward associations

The multiplicities are bad:
    - sometimes there are not specified, with the meaning that they arent interesting, therefore 0..*
    - sometimes there are not specified, meaning they default values, thus 1..1

    - solution for now ... every non navigable association end with out lower or upper explicitly given, is assigend
      mulitplicity 0..*
