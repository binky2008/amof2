/**
 * Every Object has a Class which describes its properties and operations. The
 * Object is an Instance of this Class. Object extends
 * {@link core.abstractions.elements.Element}. All model elements that
 * specialize Object inherit reflective capabilities. In particular, this
 * includes all model elements from UML2 Infrastructure.<br/> If any reflective
 * operation attempts to create cyclic containment, an
 * {@link CompositeViolation} is thrown.<br/> <b>Constraints</b>: No additional
 * constraints.<br/> <b>SemanticsClass</b>: Object is the superclass of all
 * model elements in MOF, and is the superclass of all instances of MOF model
 * elements. Each object can access its metaClass in order to obtain a Class
 * that provides a reflective description of that object. By having both MOF and
 * instances of MOF be rooted in class Object, MOF supports any number of meta
 * layers as described in Chapter 1, MOF Architecture. The following describes
 * the interaction between default values, null, isSet, and unSet.<br/>
 * <b>Single-valued properties:</b>
 * <p>
 * If a single-valued property has a default:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It is set to that default value when the object is created. isSet=false</li>
 * <li>If the value of that property is later explicitly set, even to the
 * default value, isSet=true</li>
 * <li>If the property is unSet, then the value of the property returns to the
 * default, and isSet=false</li>
 * </ul>
 * If a single-valued property does not have a default:
 * <ul>
 * <li> At creation, its value is null. isSet=false</li>
 * <li>If the value of that property is later explicitly set, even to null,
 * isSet=true</li>
 * <li>If the property is unSet, then the value of the property returns to
 * null, and isSet=false</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>Multi-valued properties:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>When the object is created, it is an empty list. isSet=false</li>
 * <li>If the list is modified in any way (except unSet), isSet=true</li>
 * <li>If the list is unSet, it is cleared and becomes an empty list.
 * <li>
 * </ul>
 * The implementation of isSet is up to the implementer. In the worst case it
 * can be implemented by having an additional boolean, but usually for a
 * particular implementation it can be implemented more efficiently (e.g. by
 * having an internal distinguished value used to represent "no value set"). For
 * default values, implementations are not required to access stored metadata at
 * runtime. It is adequate to generate a constant in the implementation class
 * for the default.
 * <p>
 * <b>Rationale</b>
 * <p>
 * Object is introduced in package Reflection so that it can be combined with
 * Core::Basic to produce EMOF which can then be merged into CMOF to provide
 * reflective capability to MOF and all instances of MOF.
